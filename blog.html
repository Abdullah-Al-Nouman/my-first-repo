    <p>The open expanse of green grass by the sea is sure to catch your eye. In this field of green grass beside the beach, a curved ditch has naturally arisen. These drains fill up with water at high tide. The green grass all around and the water in the small drains in it will fascinate anyone. You will find a secluded environment on this little known beach. Even if there are not so many waves or roars of the sea, the secluded beach of this secluded environment will catch you in a different way. If you want you can go around the sea in a fisherman’s boat. In this case, you have to bargain to fix the boat.

    There are many beautiful fields, you can take football if you want to make the moment memorable. You can also go around the sea by fishing boat, you can go around for only 2000 Taka. If you want to camp, you can stay with the tent. It would be another amazing experience.</p>
